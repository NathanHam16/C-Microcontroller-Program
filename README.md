# C-Microcontroller-Program
Uses UART, SPI, and timer peripherals of the ATTiny 1626. Pushbutton debouncing, efficient calculation methods, decoding, descrambling, mapping, serial protocol, and command messages are implemented.

Upon uploading the program to the board via UPDI, the user can select which song to play from 0-255 (0xFF). If pushbutton s1 is held then the song selected is mapped to the potentiometer position.

Pressing pushbutton S4 plays the song.
